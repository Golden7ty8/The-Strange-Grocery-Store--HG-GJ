# The-Strange-Grocery-Store--HG-GJ
Collect items from the grocery store shelves and bring them to the cashiers to make money! Beware of time dilation!


Ideas:

- Morgan (name of player character) has a sense of time that moves strangly, must often check pocket watch to update sense of time.
- After a while grocery store items change into stack of papers, symbolying unfinished projects. This will be symbolyzed by these stacks being worth less and less points as time passes, insentivising you to stick to recently created ones.

- Unsure how to incorperate this theme of the game jam yet: "- Morgan connects dots others don't see, creating insights through unconventional mental paths. (nonlinear thought)"
